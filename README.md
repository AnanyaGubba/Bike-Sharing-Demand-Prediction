# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

# 📌 1. Project Description
This project aims to predict the number of bike rentals on a given day using historical data and machine learning models. The prediction is based on factors like weather, temperature, humidity, season, time of day, and more. This use case is inspired by real-world bike-sharing platforms, which can benefit from accurate demand forecasting to optimize fleet management and service availability.

The notebook explores preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, all using Python and Scikit-learn.

# 🛠️ 2. Tech Stack Used
- Language: Python

- Development: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

- Libraries:

  - pandas – data handling

  - matplotlib and seaborn – visualizations

  - scikit-learn – machine learning models and tools

  - numpy – numerical computations

# ✨ 3. Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual insights into trends such as seasonality, hourly patterns, and weather conditions affecting bike usage.

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling of missing values, feature encoding, normalization, and feature selection.

- Model Training & Evaluation
Implementation of regression models (like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict bike demand.

- Model Performance Metrics
Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, R² Score to determine accuracy.

# ⚙️ 4. How It Works
🧪 Workflow Summary:
1. Load the Dataset
Load bike-sharing demand data (usually from CSV).

2. Preprocess the Data

  - Convert categorical variables (like seasons, weather).

  - Normalize features like temperature and humidity.

  - Extract datetime components (hour, day, month).

3. EDA and Visualization
 - Identify correlations and patterns in demand across different conditions.

4. Model Building
 - Train and tune machine learning models to predict the count of total bike rentals.

5. Evaluate and Compare Models
 - Use metrics like RMSE and R² to compare model performance.
